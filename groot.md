# Problem: Groot's pie finder

While Groot is good at heart, he is not intelligent. He loves pies but cannot find the right amount of sweetness. Groot doesn't want to eat a too sweet or bland pie. If a pie is too sweet, he wants to eat it with a pie that is bland to get to the right amount of sweetness he desires.

## Task:

You must write a function or method that returns which pies Groot has to consume to get the right amount of sweetness.

## Input:

One of the inputs is the sweetness values of the available pies and the other is the desired sweetness.

## Example:

findPies([1, 2, 3, 2, 1], 6)

returns [0, 1, 2] or [2, 1, 0]

---

findPies([8, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5], 6)

returns [1, 3] or [4]
